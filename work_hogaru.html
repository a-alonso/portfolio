								<h2 class="title is-2">Online Acquisition Experience</h2>
								<p class="subtitle is-5">Client lead conversion expierience enhanced to acquire subscriptions instead of one-shot purchases <br></p>
								<p class=''><span class='subtitle is-5'>The problem -</span>
									Since Hogaru.com is a service, it's revenues rely on how many times a new client repurchase. The churn of new clients was above 42% augmenting dramatically the cost of effective acquisition.
								</p>
								<p class=''><span class='subtitle is-5'>The solution -</span>The acquisition and pricing experience was changed to a <strong>subscription model</strong> where the client had to give a trial to a month subscription rather than one cleaning.
									Despite of the amount of cleanings purchased, the price per cleaning was defined by the weekly frequency chosen by the client.
									<br>
									After 4 months of deploying this feature, 64% of the company revenues were stabilized by subscription clients.
								</p>
								<p class=''><span class='subtitle is-5'>The UX Approach -</span>The solution was conceived and refined by UX Research and prototyping using these qualitative and quantitative methods:

								<h2 class="title is-2">Mobile ERP - Cleaners Operation Management</h2>
								<p class="subtitle is-5">Bot developed to manage cleaners daily processes <br></p>
								<p class=''><span class='subtitle is-5'>The problem -</span> Company required a monthly 30% growth in its cleaners fleet, counting ~1200 cleaners by the end of 2017. Each cleaner on a succesful journey follows 4 mandatory steps per day:
									<ol>
										<li>Confirm attendance to cleaning on the next day</li>
										<li>Confirm they are commuting to calculate ETA</li>
										<li>Confirm to begin the cleaning</li>
										<li>Confirm to finish the cleaning</li>
									</ol>
									However, mostly newcomers and cleaners having new clients had several operations issues such as getting lost finding an address or questioning how to clean something properly.
									The daily amount of processes is up to 2,700 per day, making unsustainable to build up a support team of 1 operator per 20 cleaners.
								</p>
								<p class=''><span class='subtitle is-5'>The solution -</span>A mobile bot was embedded in their mobile app to simulate a chat with a virtual operator that replies immediatly to any requirement the cleaner has. Manual communication is held only when a situation requires attention
									<br>
									The virtual operator "Amanda" currently <strong> replies automatically to the 76% of conversations</strong> with cleaners and manages the daily operations with no hassle.
									A sandbox tool was deployed for the ops team to add or remove options the cleaners can choose when using the bot. Watch the news report about this ERP:
